## This can be enabled seperatly in each of the authenticators that use this template. Some may
## allow registration during login while other don't. As a best practice, create two different
## authenticators -- one for cases where users will authenticate _inside_ a mobile app (i.e., in a
## browser view) and one for apps where that won't be the case. Do not allow registration for all
## apps/service providers where this will be viewed in an embedded view. This results in too much
## context switching, and is best if the person uses a different device for this (e.g., their laptop).
## When the app won't be empedding this view, registration can be quite helpful to allow even when
## logging in.
